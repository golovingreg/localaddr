# localaddr
A shortcut to quickly look up the IP address of the host machine for local development. I use it to just avoid copying 35 lines of code into my short scripts.

The solution is "heavily inspired" by the accepted answer by Sebastian in this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23558425/how-do-i-get-the-local-ip-address-in-go
